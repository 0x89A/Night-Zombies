* **Kill murderers** - If set to true, murderes and scarecrows will die at sunrise leaving a corpse, if set to false they will be destroyed leaving no corpse.
* **Broadcast spawn amount** - Send chat message with number of murderers/scarecrows spawned (only initial spawn).
* **Broadcast murderer and scarecrow count separately** - Separate the number of murderers and scarecrows spawned in the chat broadcast.
* **Slow Destroy** - Kills/destroys zombies gradually instead of all at once. Use if there are a large number of zombies on your server, causing lag when destroyed all at once.
